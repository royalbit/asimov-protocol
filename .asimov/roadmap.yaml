# migrations.yaml details:
#   For migration projects (language migrations, framework upgrades, rewrites),
#   ensure the new code functions identically to the original.
#
#   Potential approaches:
#   - Test parity: Same test suite passes on old and new
#   - Contract testing: Define input/output contracts, verify both satisfy
#   - Property-based testing: Generate inputs, compare outputs
#   - Shadow mode: Run both in parallel, diff results
#   - Behavioral snapshots: Capture old behavior, assert new matches
#   - API contract verification: OpenAPI/gRPC schema compatibility
#   - Database migration validation: Data integrity checks
#
#   Key principle: "Migration complete" = "functionally equivalent" not just "compiles"
