  version: "9.2.3"
  status: released
  summary: "Fix unconditional migrations protocol loading"
  goal: "migrations.json should only load for migration-type projects, not all projects"

backlog:
  - "Session Controller: spawn() instead of exec() to supervise Claude Code, watch for compaction signals, auto-inject warmup before context loss - true self-healing"
  - "Deliverables Template (ADR-034): auto-append standard checklist to milestones based on project type - needs design for how to inject/display"
