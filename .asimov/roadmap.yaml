# RoyalBit Asimov Roadmap
#
# WHAT to build - milestones only
# See: CHANGELOG.md for release history

# current: (none - see CHANGELOG.md for v10.2.5)

backlog:
  - "Session Controller: spawn() instead of exec() to supervise Claude Code, watch for compaction signals, auto-inject warmup before context loss - true self-healing"
  - "Deliverables Template (ADR-034): auto-append standard checklist to milestones based on project type"
