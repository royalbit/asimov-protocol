# WHAT to build - milestones only
# See: CHANGELOG.md for release history

  status: released
  summary: "Kill asimov-zed Extension"

next:
  - version: "8.0.0"
    summary: "Enforced Protocol Loading + Token Optimization"
    goal: SECURITY
    priority: CRITICAL
    phases:
      phase_1_fix_ethics_mess:
        - "Remove ethics.yaml references from validator (asimov.yaml is canonical)"
        - "Stop auto-regenerating ethics.yaml"
        - "Update all templates to use asimov.yaml only"
        - "Delete .asimov/ethics.yaml after code cleanup"
      phase_2_enforce_loading:
        - "Hardcode 6 core protocols in Rust binary"
        - "Protocols: asimov, freshness, sycophancy, green, sprint, warmup"
        - "Dynamic date injection ({TODAY}, {YEAR} from env)"
        - "NO hardcoded model cutoff (Claude knows its own cutoff)"
        - "Extension mechanism (extend, not disable)"
      phase_3_token_optimization:
        - "Output format: minified JSON with full words"
        - "Target: ~40% token reduction"
        - "No abbreviations (Claude must understand)"
      final:
        - "ADR-031 implemented"

backlog:
  - "TOON Format Migration: Evaluate when Rust parser matures (token efficiency)"
