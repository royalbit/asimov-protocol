  summary: "Command Fixes from Validation"
  goal: Quality
  priority: HIGH
  deliverables:
    # From validation backlog
    - "[ ] Fix: asimov (no args) launcher - try spawn() instead of exec() for proper Claude Code launch with warmup"
    - "[ ] Fix: asimov init MUST require --name and --type flags (no auto-detection)"
    - "[ ] Fix: asimov validate - no args, validate ALL (protocols .json vs hardcoded, roadmap.yaml, project.yaml vs schemas)"
    - "[ ] Remove: asimov check command (redundant with simplified validate)"
    - "[ ] Fix: asimov lint-docs - use markdownlint-cli2, scan ALL .md files in ./ and subdirs"
    - "[ ] Fix: asimov refresh - regenerate .json protocol files, update roadmap.yaml to new schema if needed"
    - "[ ] Remove: asimov schema command + ADR (CLI autonomous mode, no IDE integration)"
    - "[ ] Fix: asimov update - download correct binary for platform from GH releases, install to current PATH location"
    - "[ ] Fix: asimov warmup - simplify for mid-session recovery (just milestone + protocols JSON), verbose only on session start"
    - "[ ] Fix: asimov stats - show ENTIRE project stats (since asimov init) + current session, use git tag to mark init point"
    - "[ ] Fix: asimov doctor - auto-create empty roadmap.yaml if missing (don't suggest init)"
