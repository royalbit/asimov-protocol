# ADR-035: Qowat Milat Reframe

## Status

**ACCEPTED** - 2025-12-02

## Context

RoyalBit Asimov documentation contained factual analysis of AI platform behaviors, supported by citations from reputable sources. The editorial framing was revised to let evidence speak for itself.

### The Qowat Milat Principle

From Star Trek (Picard), Qowat Milat is the Way of Absolute Candor:

> Speak truth. But survive to speak it.

Applied to documentation:
- **Keep the facts** - Citations, research, evidence remain
- **Neutral framing** - Present observations without editorial interpretation
- **Let readers conclude** - Evidence speaks for itself

## Decision

Reframe 7 files (~30 edits) to maintain factual accuracy with neutral framing.

### Files Updated

| File | Edits |
|------|-------|
| `docs/AI_REALITY.md` | 13 |
| `docs/adr/022-date-aware-search-protocol.md` | 7 |
| `docs/adr/015-anti-sycophancy-protocol.md` | 5 |
| `README.md` | 2 |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | 1 |
| `docs/adr/023-inaction-principle.md` | 2 |
| `docs/ORIGIN_STORY.md` | 1 |

### What Was Preserved

All factual content with citations remains intact:
- Research statistics from peer-reviewed sources
- Cost data from public documentation
- Official vendor documentation quotes
- Third-party analysis (TechCrunch, Nature, Stanford/Harvard)

Third-party characterizations are now explicitly attributed rather than endorsed.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Professional tone** - Documents observations neutrally
2. **Higher credibility** - Evidence speaks for itself
3. **Maintains truth** - All facts and citations preserved

### Negative

1. **Requires context** - Readers draw their own conclusions

### Neutral

1. **Precedent set** - Future documentation follows this pattern

## References
