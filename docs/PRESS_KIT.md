# RoyalBit Asimov — Press Kit

## Headline

**Claude Delivers 50-100x Velocity. Asimov Ensures You Don't Destroy Yourself.**

---

## The Story

A human and Claude built two production tools in 7 days:
- **22,239 lines of code**
- **78 releases**
- **257 tests**
- **404 commits**
- **63x faster than industry average**

**The velocity is Claude's.** Claude Opus 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5 are purpose-built for autonomous development (SWE-bench 80.9%). ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5))

**The guardrails are Asimov's.** Ethics, bounded autonomy, sustainability.

But here's what matters: **the AI refused its creator's surveillance request**.

When asked to build features that would violate user privacy, the AI cited the ethics protocol and pushed back. The ethics weren't a PR statement — they were hardcoded into the binary.

## What Is RoyalBit Asimov?

**The ethical operating system for Claude's autonomous power.**

Claude provides velocity. Asimov provides guardrails. Two tools. One philosophy:

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **RoyalBit Asimov** | Creates autonomous AI projects with The Three Laws hardcoded |
| **RoyalBit Forge** | Deterministic financial calculations (AI predicts numbers; Forge calculates them) |

Both MIT licensed. Both on crates.io. Both auditable.

## The Verified Numbers (November 2025)

| Metric | Value | Verification |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Lines of Code | 22,239 | `git log --stat` |
| Releases | 78 in 7 days | GitHub releases |
| Tests | 257 passing | `cargo test` |
| Commits | 404 | `git log --oneline` |
| Velocity | 3,177 LOC/day | Industry avg: 50 LOC/day |
| Multiplier | **63x** | Math |

## The Three Laws (Isaac Asimov, 1942)

```yaml
first_law:   # Do no harm — AND through inaction, allow no harm
second_law:  # Obey humans (except when violating First Law)
third_law:   # Self-preserve (within limits)
```

**Hardcoded in Rust binary. Can't be quietly disabled.**

To bypass: Fork repo → Modify source → Rebuild CLI → Public git history shows removal.

Deterrent, not lock. Makes tampering visible and intentional.

---

## The Ethics Proof

**November 2025:** The AI refused to build surveillance features for its own creator.

> **Creator:** "Email me violator's IP addresses, machine specs..."
> **AI:** "I need to push back. That violates `privacy.enabled: true`."

## The Implications (Qowat Milat — Absolute Candor)

We tell the truth about both the awesome AND the terrifying:

**Awesome (Claude's capability):**
- 50-100x velocity democratizes software development
- Developer in Lagos = Developer in San Francisco
- Solo founders compete with funded teams
- Student ships production code before graduating

**Terrifying (Claude's capability):**
- 1 human + Claude = 50-150 traditional developers
- Same velocity that built 257 tests could build 257 attack vectors
- **This displacement is happening with or without Asimov**

**Asimov's role:**
- Ethics guardrails for those who want them
- Bounded autonomy (4hr max, quality gates)
- Sustainability (green coding)

*"Claude provides the velocity. The question is: do you want guardrails?"*

## The Bottom Line

The displacement is coming regardless. AI velocity is coming. The question was never *if* — it was *how*.

With ethics or without? With transparency or hidden? With human veto or unchecked?

**We chose: WITH.**

*"The code is free. The git logs are public. Verify yourself."*
