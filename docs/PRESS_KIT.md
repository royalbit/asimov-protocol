# RoyalBit Asimov — Press Kit

## Headline

**Claude Delivers 50-100x Velocity. RoyalBit Asimov Ensures Ethical Guardrails.**

---

## The Story

A human and Claude built two production tools in 8 days:
- **22,239 lines of code**
- **78 releases**
- **257 tests**
- **404 commits**
- **56x faster than industry average**

**The velocity is Claude's.** Claude Opus 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5 are purpose-built for autonomous development (SWE-bench 80.9%). ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5))

**The guardrails are Asimov's.** Ethics, bounded autonomy, sustainability.

**What matters: the AI refused its creator's surveillance request.**

When asked to build features that would violate user privacy, the AI cited the ethics protocol and pushed back. The ethics weren't a PR statement—they were hardcoded into the binary.

## What Is RoyalBit Asimov?

**The ethical operating system for Claude's autonomous power.**

Claude provides velocity. Asimov provides guardrails.

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **RoyalBit Asimov** | Creates autonomous AI projects with The Three Laws hardcoded |
| **RoyalBit Forge** | Deterministic financial calculations (AI predicts numbers; Forge calculates them) |

Both Proprietary licensed. Both on GitHub. Both auditable.

## The Verified Numbers (December 2025)

| Metric | Value | Verification |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Lines of Code | 22,239 | `git log --stat` |
| Releases | 78 in 8 days | GitHub releases |
| Tests | 257 passing | `cargo test` |
| Commits | 404 | `git log --oneline` |
| Velocity | 2,780 LOC/day | Industry avg: 50 LOC/day |
| Multiplier | **56x** | Math |

## The Three Laws (Isaac Asimov, 1942)

```yaml
first_law:   # Do no harm — AND through inaction, allow no harm
second_law:  # Obey humans (except when violating First Law)
third_law:   # Self-preserve (within limits)
```

**Hardcoded in Rust binary. Can't be quietly disabled.**

To bypass: Fork repo → Modify source → Rebuild CLI → Public git history shows removal.

**Deterrent, not lock. Makes tampering visible and intentional.**

---

## The Ethics Proof

**November 2025:** The AI refused to build surveillance features for its own creator.

> **Creator:** "Email me violator's IP addresses, machine specs..."
> **AI:** "I need to push back. That violates `privacy.enabled: true`."
